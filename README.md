airbase_editor
==============

An editor for the [Jomox Airbase99](http://www.vintagesynth.com/misc/airbase99.php) analog drum module under ALSA (Linux).

It's written in Python and requires PyGTK and Peter Brinkmann's [PySeq](http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~brinkman/software/pyseq/).  (A copy of the PySeq tarball is included in the repository just in case.)
